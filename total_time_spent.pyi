Logs total time I spent on the project

Mar 15, 2019 (Fri)  2 hours completing task breakdown (primary) on Trello
                    2 hours researching games
Mar 16, 2019 (Sat)  1 hours reading about arcade, openGL, and git
                    2 hours making a keyboard template on AutoCAD
                    3 hours getting started with the project + Git & GitHub
Mar 17, 2019 (Sun)  7 hours stuck with keyboard
                    2 hours digging into arcade's code and figure out how to manipulate buffered vertex objects
                    1 hour to display on-screen keyboard and fix some bugs
Mar 18, 2019 (Mon)  6 hours refactoring keyboard.py, added opacity
Mar 20, 2019 (Wed)  1/2 hour more refactoring
Mar 21, 2019 (Thu)  1/2 hour researching patterns
                    1/2 hour add key response when pressed to figure out what to do next
                    1 hour add some kind of premature graphic showing when to press, seems to blocky, time
                            also seems to not be constant. Seems to be working my high-specs laptop a bit
                            hard too. Should probably research about multithreading and other stuffs. Or use
                            other alternatives such as pre-made animation/video. Or textures/sprites might be
                            a better way to go about this.
