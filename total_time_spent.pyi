Logs total old_time I spent on the project

Mar 15, 2019 (Fri)  2 hours completing task breakdown (primary) on Trello
                    2 hours researching games
Mar 16, 2019 (Sat)  1 hour reading about arcade, openGL, and git
                    2 hours making a keyboard template on AutoCAD
                    3 hours getting started with the project + Git & GitHub
Mar 17, 2019 (Sun)  7 hours stuck with keyboard
                    2 hours digging into arcade's code and figure out how to manipulate VBOs
                    1 hour to display on-screen keyboard and fix some bugs
Mar 18, 2019 (Mon)  6 hours refactoring keyboard.py, added opacity
Mar 20, 2019 (Wed)  1/2 hour more refactoring
Mar 21, 2019 (Thu)  1/2 hour researching patterns
                    1/2 hour add key response when pressed to figure out what to do next
                    1 hour add some kind of premature graphic showing when to press, seems too
                            blocky, old_time also seems to not be constant. Seems to be working my
                            high-specs laptop a bit hard too. Should probably research about
                            multi-threading and other stuffs. Or use other alternatives such as
                            pre-made animation/video. Or textures/sprites might be a better way
                            to go about this.
Mar 22, 2019 (Fri)  2 hours Temporarily solved the FPS problem. No need to read pyglet for now.
                            (except for old_time) I guess.

Mar 28, 2019 (Thu)  2 hours refactoring (and broking something) getting new things ready and
                            optimizing key's animation stack
                    5 min   after showering break + Mo's advice solved the problem
